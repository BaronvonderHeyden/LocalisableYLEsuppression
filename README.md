## Overview

> The repository contains the following
> 1. the main model (written in Julia): model functions are in `new model v9.jl` (folder `code`)
> 2. all simulation result files (folder `simulation results`), e.g. for parameter scans which otherwise would take a few hours to simulate (corresponding code is deactivated in Jupyter notebooks, instead model simulation results are loaded from files)
> 3. Jupyter notebooks demonstrating which code is needed to generate which outputs (folder `Jupyter notebooks`)
> 4. all plots generated by the code (folder `plots`)

## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ReneGeci/LocalisableYLEsuppression.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/ReneGeci/LocalisableYLEsuppression/archive/master.zip).


## Dependencies
To run the model, you need to at least install Julia and all package dependencies required to run the model.

To learn more about the installation of Julia [go here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Starting point
As a starting point, go to `Jupyter notebooks` and then `Introduction.ipynb`. This notebook gives you a short introduction to how to run the model.

After this go to `Publication figures + code.ipynb` (in the same folder) where you will see which lines were run to perform the simulations shown in the publication.

If you then want to have an even deeper understanding go to `Jupyter notebooks`>`Modelling fundamentals.ipynb` to see how the model actually works and eventually to `Code`>`new model v9.jl` if you want to have a look at the source code functions themselves.
